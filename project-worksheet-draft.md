# Title: Volcanic Flow Hazards
#### Group Members: Lillian Hanson, Clara Pugh

### Motivation: 
Volcanic lava flows have the potential to cause extreme damage to life and property.
### Question:
How do the physical properties of lava, such as viscosity and temperature, influence the flow behavior and potential hazard level of volcanic eruptions?
### Hypothesis:
Higher viscosity lava results in slower, thicker flows that build up steeper volcanic structures, while lower viscosity lava spreads more rapidly, covering larger areas and posing different hazards to communities and ecosystems.
### Sources: 
- Utilize simulations and data from the NOAA Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) to model lava flow behavior under different conditions.
- United States Geological Survey (USGS) Volcano Hazards Program 
- Consider the role of external factors such as terrain, atmospheric conditions, and eruption dynamics in determining lava spread.
- Smithsonian Institution Global Volcanism Program – Offers data on volcanic eruptions, lava flows, and historical case studies.
- Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research – Publishes scientific studies on lava flow mechanics and hazard mitigation strategies.
